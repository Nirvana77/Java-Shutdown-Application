# Java-Shutdown-Application

This project is a shutdown scheduler application built with JavaFX. The application allows the user to set specific
times for their computer to automatically shutdown every day of the week. The user can also set a delay for the shutdown
to occur if specific programs are running. The application also has a GUI where the user can easily set or change the
shutdown times, as well as start or stop the shutdown scheduler. The application is designed to be user-friendly and
easy to use.
